The event was organised on Airmeet.
During the hackathon, various other informal activities were conducted to allow the participants to take a quality break from their work and feel refreshed. There were separate channels created where participants could play games like Scribble, Among Us, etc. 
There were two mentoring sessions for the participants where they can discuss ideas and seek guidance from skilled mentors. Judges provided them industrial and real-world insights about their projects and work and also showed them the way to taking it further after the hackathon.

## Feedback from Attendees  ![speech_balloon](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4ac.png)

We circulated proper feedback forms after the event and the response was good.
